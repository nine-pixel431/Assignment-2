# Assignment-2

**2.1: Check if a number is even or odd**
- Purpose: This Python script determines whether a user-provided integer is an even or odd number.
- User Input: The program prompts the user to enter a number via the console.
- Logic: It uses the modulo operator (%) and an if-else conditional statement to check divisibility by 2.
- Output: The script prints a message to the console indicating the result (whether the entered number is even or odd).

**2.2: Sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a loop**
- Initialization: A variable n is initialized to 0 to store the running total of the sum.
- Iteration: A for loop iterates through a sequence of numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 51, effectively covering the range of 1 to 50.
- Calculation and Output: Inside the loop, each number is added to the n variable. After the loop completes, the final result is printed to the console using an f-string.
